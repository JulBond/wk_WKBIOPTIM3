As you test - please document everything that looks a bit unclear or does not work at first - it will be fundamental 
for final documentation and improvement of the scripts and annotations

Note on r version: 
these scripts are being developed in ...R version 3.4.1...yes I know...but if I update R now it will be much more than this that will stops running in my computer...
...so...let me know issues you have and I look for a compatible change that makes it work for both. 
Apologies for the inconvenience.
